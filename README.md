### **Predicting Stocks with ML**

**Trend Pulse is an ML-powered stock price prediction app built with Python and Streamlit. It utilizes machine learning models to forecast stock prices and help investors make data-driven decisions.**

## üèóÔ∏è **How It's Built**

Stockastic is built with these core frameworks and modules:

- **Streamlit** - To create the web app UI and interactivity 
- **LSTM** - To build the Long Short Term Memory model
- **Plotly** - To create interactive financial charts

The app workflow is:

1. User feeds the CSV file.
2. Historical data is fetched with CSV file.
3. LSTM model is trained on the data 
4. Model makes multi-day price forecasts
5. Results are plotted with Plotly

## üéØ **Key Features**

- **Financial charts** - Interactive historical and forecast charts
- **LSTM forecasting** - Make statistically robust predictions
- **Backtesting** - Evaluate model performance
