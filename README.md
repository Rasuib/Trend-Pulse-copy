 ## **Motto: " We Together Can Bring A Change "**

 # LSTM-Based Stock Prediction Model

## Project Overview

This project is dedicated to forecasting stock market prices using a deep learning model based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. By analyzing historical stock data, this model aims to predict future price movements, providing valuable insights for investors and traders looking to make informed decisions.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Includes cleaning and normalization of historical stock price data.
- **LSTM Model**: Utilizes a deep learning approach with LSTM layers to learn from the temporal dependencies of stock price movements.
- **Prediction**: Generates future stock prices based on historical data.
- **Evaluation**: Assesses the model's performance using metrics like RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error).
- **Visualization**: Plots historical data against predicted values for easy comparison.

## Technology Stack

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow/Keras
- Pandas for data manipulation
- Matplotlib for data visualization
- Yahoo Finance API for fetching historical stock data

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system. You will also need to install several Python libraries, including TensorFlow, Keras, Pandas, and Matplotlib. You can install these packages using pip:

```bash
pip install tensorflow keras pandas matplotlib
``` 


## Installation
### Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
https://github.com/Rhythm-shahane/Trend-Pulse.git
```

# üìà **Trend Pulse**
### **Predicting Stocks with ML**

**Trend Pulse is an ML-powered stock price prediction app built with Python and Streamlit. It utilizes machine learning models to forecast stock prices and help investors make data-driven decisions.**

## üèóÔ∏è **How It's Built**

Stockastic is built with these core frameworks and modules:

- **Streamlit** - To create the web app UI and interactivity 
- **LSTM** - To build the Long Short Term Memory model
- **Plotly** - To create interactive financial charts

The app workflow is:

1. User feeds the CSV file.
2. Historical data is fetched with CSV file.
3. LSTM model is trained on the data 
4. Model makes multi-day price forecasts
5. Results are plotted with Plotly

## üéØ **Key Features**

- **Financial charts** - Interactive historical and forecast charts
- **LSTM forecasting** - Make statistically robust predictions
- **Backtesting** - Evaluate model performance
- **Responsive design** - Works on all devices

## üöÄ **Getting Started**

### **Local Installation**

1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Rhythm-shahane/Trend-Pulse.git
```

2. Install requirements

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Change directory
```bash
cd app.py
```

4. Run the app

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## üìà **Future Roadmap**

Some potential features for future releases:

- **More advanced forecasting models like Transformer**
- **Quantitative trading strategies**
- **Portfolio optimization and tracking**
- **Additional fundamental data**
- **User account system**
- **Real Time Data Fetching**
